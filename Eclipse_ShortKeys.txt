1. Ctrl + Shift + O shortcut, which automatically imports unrecognized classes in code.
2. Correct Indentation (Ctrl + I)  -Code readability is important—when you’re reading your own code at a later date, or when somebody else is.
3. Delete Current Line (Ctrl + D)
4. Then hit the Ctrl + Space key combination. This brings up a list of autocomplete recommendations along with method signatures, variable types, and more.
Select the recommendation you want to apply, hit the Enter key, and keep coding.
5. System.out.println ("sysout" and Ctrl + Space)
6. Search Entire Project (Ctrl + H)
7. Run Application (Ctrl + F11)
The first time you run a new project, you should do it through Run > Run As... > Java Application. But after that, you can speed things up with the Ctrl + F11 shortcut. This runs the current project using the same configuration as the last time you ran it.
8. Rename (Alt + Shift + R)
Here's the thing about class, method, and variable names: your code might contain references to them many, many times. Now imagine if you ever needed to change the name of a class, method, or variable. It could take hours (or even days) to rename every single reference.
Or you can right-click on the name, select Refactor > Rename, and type in the new name. Eclipse will then instantly change every single reference in the entire project. Even faster, you can click on the name, hit Alt + Shift + R, type in the new name, and hit Enter. Bam, done!
